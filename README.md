Python Implementation of Knuth's Mastermind Algorithm

This problem was presented to me in a college course - minus the Knuth solution.  The implementation language was SML which I may come back to some day.
I spend hours on this problem and had I been aware of the paper, could have solved it sooner.

For some reason, this assignment was always in the back of my mind since then.  The time has come to solve it - albeit cheating via Knuth.
